Drawings are constrained to the 'bounding box' of 300x300 px. Measurements and locations given in the drawings files are based on this assumption. 

Frames can be composed of multiple layers. Layers are named by frame number, then sub-number based on the zorder. 

The frameNumber.f layer indicates the zorder of the face and the associated location information.
